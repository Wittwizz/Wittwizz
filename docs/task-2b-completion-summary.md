# WITTWIZZ-CALC-002B Completion Summary

## Ticket Details
- **Ticket ID**: WITTWIZZ-CALC-002B
- **Title**: Add Quick and Advanced mode UI
- **Description**: Default to Quick mode with 3 presets; toggle to Advanced for detailed items.
- **Dependencies**: WITTWIZZ-CALC-002A
- **Priority**: P1
- **Expected Outcome**: UI toggle works; selected mode updates displayed options.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

The Quick and Advanced mode UI has been successfully implemented in the Calculator component. The feature was already present in the codebase and working correctly.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Mode State Management**
   - `mode` state variable with type `'quick' | 'advanced'`
   - Defaults to `'quick'` mode as requested

2. **Mode Toggle UI**
   - Clean toggle button group with Quick/Advanced options
   - Visual feedback showing active mode
   - Responsive design with proper hover states

3. **Conditional Content Rendering**
   - **Quick Mode**: Displays 3 presets (Starter, Sprint, Scale) in a grid layout
   - **Advanced Mode**: Shows individual service items with checkboxes and detailed information

4. **Seamless Mode Switching**
   - Toggle between modes updates displayed options immediately
   - Maintains selected items when switching modes
   - Preserves user selections across mode changes

### Technical Implementation

The implementation leverages React's conditional rendering pattern:

```tsx
{mode === 'quick' ? (
  // Quick mode: Preset cards
  <div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3">
    {presets.map(preset => (
      <Card key={preset.id} onClick={() => handlePresetSelect(preset.id)}>
        {/* Preset content */}
      </Card>
    ))}
  </div>
) : (
  // Advanced mode: Individual service items
  <div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
    {items.map(item => (
      <Card key={item.id}>
        {/* Service item content with checkboxes */}
      </Card>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

### User Experience Features

1. **Intuitive Mode Selection**
   - Clear visual distinction between modes
   - Descriptive text for each mode
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects

2. **Context-Aware Messaging**
   - Quick mode: "Not sure what to pick? Start with a preset. You can fine-tune anytime."
   - Advanced mode: "Prefer custom? Pick only what you need."

3. **Consistent Summary Display**
   - Summary sidebar adapts to show relevant information for each mode
   - Mode-specific placeholder text when no items are selected

### Testing Results

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Build process: Successful
- ✅ Dev server: Running successfully
- ✅ UI components: All rendering correctly
- ✅ Mode switching: Functional and responsive

### Dependencies Satisfied

This ticket was dependent on `WITTWIZZ-CALC-002A` which provided:
- Updated data structure with `id`, `label`, `price_pre_gst` fields
- Proper TypeScript types for `Service` and `Preset`
- Calculation functions that work with the new data format

### Files Modified

No files were modified for this ticket as the Quick/Advanced mode UI was already implemented and working correctly in:
- `src/sections/Calculator.tsx` - Main component with mode toggle and conditional rendering

### Next Steps

The Quick and Advanced mode UI is fully functional and ready for user testing. The implementation provides:
- A clean, intuitive interface for users to choose between preset packages and custom service selection
- Seamless mode switching without losing user selections
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes
- Proper accessibility with ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Deployment Notes

- No deployment required - feature was already present
- Build process completed successfully
- Dev server running for testing
- All TypeScript types are properly defined and validated

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ UI defaults to Quick mode with 3 presets
- ✅ Toggle to Advanced mode for detailed items
- ✅ UI toggle works correctly
- ✅ Selected mode updates displayed options
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
