# WITTWIZZ-CALC-002A Completion Summary

## Ticket Details
- **Ticket ID**: WITTWIZZ-CALC-002A
- **Title**: Define new presets and service items
- **Priority**: P1
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Requirements Fulfilled

### ✅ Updated services.json Structure
The `content/pricing/services.json` file has been updated to match the required field structure:

**Presets** (3 total):
- **Starter**: Best for first launch (7 days, ₹10,000 pre-GST)
- **Sprint**: Launch in 30 days (30 days, ₹30,000 pre-GST) 
- **Scale**: Grow & optimise (45 days, ₹50,000 pre-GST)

**Service Items** (6 total):
- **Brand Kit**: A usable identity & starter assets (3 days, ₹8,000 pre-GST)
- **One-Page Site**: A fast, SEO-ready landing page (4 days, ₹10,000 pre-GST)
- **Shopify Basic**: A live store with 20 products (10 days, ₹20,000 pre-GST)
- **Content Kit**: Reusable content to post for 30 days (7 days, ₹8,000 pre-GST)
- **SEO Lite**: Technical fixes & 30-day uplift (7 days, ₹7,000 pre-GST)
- **Analytics Setup**: See what works in one dashboard (2 days, ₹3,000 pre-GST)

### ✅ Required Fields Implemented
All required fields are now present in the data structure:
- `id` (replaces `key`)
- `label` (replaces `name`) 
- `outcome` (descriptive text for each service)
- `includes[]` (array of what's included, replaces `whats_included`)
- `days` (timeline estimate)
- `price_pre_gst` (pre-GST pricing)
- `discount_pct` (individual item discount percentage)

### ✅ Code Updates
**Type Definitions** (`src/lib/calc.ts`):
- Updated `Service` and `Preset` types to use new field names
- Added `price_pre_gst` and `discount_pct` fields
- Changed `whats_included` to `includes`

**Calculator Component** (`src/sections/Calculator.tsx`):
- Updated all field references from old structure to new structure
- Modified price calculations to work with `price_pre_gst`
- Updated fallback data to match new structure
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

**Calculation Functions**:
- `sumIncl()` now handles both `price_pre_gst` and legacy `price_incl_gst`
- `getPriceDisplay()` prioritizes `price_pre_gst` for new structure
- GST calculations automatically convert pre-GST to inclusive pricing

### ✅ Pricing Structure
- **Pre-GST Pricing**: All prices are now stored as pre-GST amounts
- **GST Rate**: Maintained at 18% as per Indian tax requirements
- **Bundle Discounts**: Preserved existing tiered discount structure (5%, 10%, 15%)
- **Individual Discounts**: Added `discount_pct` field for per-item discounts

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
The system maintains backward compatibility by:
- Supporting both `price_pre_gst` (new) and `price_incl_gst` (legacy)
- Gracefully handling missing fields
- Providing fallback data with new structure

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **services.json** → Loaded by Calculator component
2. **Field Mapping** → `id` → `key`, `label` → `name`, `includes` → `whats_included`
3. **Price Calculation** → `price_pre_gst` → Converted to incl-GST for display
4. **UI Rendering** → All references updated to use new field names

### Build Status
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: No errors
✅ **Vite Build**: Successful production build
✅ **Field Validation**: All required fields present and properly typed

## Testing Recommendations
