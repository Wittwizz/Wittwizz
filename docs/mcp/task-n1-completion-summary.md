- **Rate limiting** and retry logic for API stability
- **Default values** for common fields (Type: Chore, Priority: Medium, Owner: Himanshu)

### 3. Environment Configuration (`/docs/mcp/.env.sample`)
- **Notion API key** placeholder for integration token
- **Database ID** placeholder for progress board
- **Security notes** ensuring no secrets are committed
- **Integration** with existing MCP server configuration

### 4. Status Tracking (`/docs/mcp/notion_status.json`)
- **Test result tracking** for all Notion integration tests
- **Connection health monitoring** with timestamps
- **Error logging** for debugging and troubleshooting
- **Next actions** clearly defined for implementation

### 5. Project Structure Updates
- **Automation directory** created with README explaining purpose
- **MCP connection plan** updated to include Notion server status
- **MCP status file** updated with Notion server configuration
- **Integration roadmap** defined for Task N2 (Sync rules)

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Notion Database Requirements
- **12 properties** with specific types and naming conventions
- **5 status values** for task lifecycle management
- **4 type categories** for task classification
- **4 priority levels** for urgency management
- **Integration permissions** requiring "Full access"

### API Integration Points
- **Base URL**: `https://api.notion.com/v1`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with `secret_` prefix
- **Version**: `2022-06-28` API version
- **Rate Limits**: 60 requests per minute with retry logic

### Automation Triggers
- **Cursor**: Task creation, status updates, field changes
- **GitHub**: PR opened, updated, merged
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility reports
- **Manual**: Status updates and progress tracking

## üìã Acceptance Criteria Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] `notion_setup.md` contains property schema and troubleshooting notes
- [x] `notion_mappings.json` exists and reflects exact property names
- [x] All required files created with valid structure
- [x] Project structure updated to include Notion integration

### ‚è≥ Pending User Action
- [ ] Set `NOTION_API_KEY` and `NOTION_DB_ID` environment variables
- [ ] Create Notion integration and database
- [ ] Run connectivity tests and page creation/update tests
- [ ] Verify all tests pass before proceeding

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Himanshu (Immediate)
1. **Create Notion Integration**
   - Visit [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Create "Wittwizz Digital MCP" integration
   - Copy Internal Integration Token

2. **Create Progress Board Database**
   - Create new page with `/database` table
   - Name: "Wittwizz Progress Board"
   - Add integration with "Full access" permissions
   - Copy database ID from URL

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Copy `docs/mcp/.env.sample` to `.env`
   - Fill in Notion credentials
   - Never commit `.env` to version control

### For Cursor (After Configuration)
1. **Run Connectivity Tests**
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test API connectivity
   - Execute page creation and update tests

2. **Update Status Files**
   - Mark tests as passed in `notion_status.json`
   - Update MCP connection plan
   - Proceed to Task N2 (Sync rules)

## üîí Security & Compliance

### API Key Management
- **Environment variables** for secure storage
- **Least privilege** access with specific capabilities
- **No secrets** committed to version control
- **Regular rotation** recommended for production

### Data Privacy
- **Minimal data collection** for progress tracking
- **Purpose-limited** to task synchronization
- **User consent** through integration permissions
- **Data retention** aligned with project lifecycle

## üìä Integration Benefits

### Real-time Progress Tracking
- **Automated status updates** from development tools
- **Centralized progress board** for team visibility
- **Performance metrics** integration with Lighthouse
- **Task lifecycle** management from creation to completion

### Developer Experience
- **Seamless workflow** between Cursor and Notion
- **Automated documentation** of progress and decisions
- **Performance monitoring** with automated reporting
- **Collaboration** through shared progress visibility

## üéâ Task N1 Status: COMPLETED

All deliverables have been created and the Notion MCP integration is ready for configuration. The next phase (Task N2) will focus on implementing the automated sync rules and webhook handlers to keep Notion updated from GitHub PRs and Cursor task lifecycle.

**Ready for Himanshu to proceed with Notion setup and configuration.**
