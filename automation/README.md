# Automation Directory

This directory contains configuration files and mappings for automating the synchronization between Cursor tasks, GitHub PRs, and Notion progress tracking.

## Files

### `notion_mappings.json`
- Maps Cursor events and fields to Notion database properties
- Defines automation rules for different triggers
- Configures webhook endpoints and rate limits
- Sets default values for common fields

## Purpose

The automation system enables:
1. **Real-time sync** between development tools and progress tracking
2. **Automated status updates** based on GitHub PR lifecycle
3. **Performance tracking** integration with Lighthouse reports
4. **Task lifecycle management** from Cursor to Notion

## Integration Points

- **Cursor**: Task creation, updates, and status changes
- **GitHub**: PR lifecycle (opened, updated, merged)
- **Notion**: Progress board with structured data
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility scores

## Next Steps

After Task N1 completion:
1. Implement webhook handlers for each integration point
2. Set up automated sync rules (Task N2)
3. Configure error handling and retry logic
4. Monitor sync health and performance

## Security Notes

- All API keys stored in environment variables
- Webhook endpoints require authentication
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Error logging for debugging and monitoring
