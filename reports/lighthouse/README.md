# Lighthouse Reports

This directory will contain performance and accessibility audit reports generated by Google Lighthouse.

## What is Lighthouse?
Lighthouse is a free, open-source tool that audits web pages for:
- **Performance** - How fast the page loads and responds
- **Accessibility** - How usable the page is for all users
- **Best Practices** - Following web development standards
- **SEO** - Search engine optimization
- **Progressive Web App** - PWA capabilities

## Why It Matters
- **User Experience**: Faster pages = better user engagement
- **SEO**: Google considers page speed in rankings
- **Accessibility**: Ensures your site works for everyone
- **Business Impact**: Better performance = higher conversions

## Target Scores (from acceptance-gates.json)
- **Performance**: 90+/100
- **Accessibility**: 95+/100
- **Best Practices**: 90+/100
- **SEO**: 90+/100
